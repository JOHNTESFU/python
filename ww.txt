Hi Balcha,
	Hey what a great day. Not too shiny and not to cloudy just the perfect day to imagine the good things that can happen in the future. Speaking of 
future i registered to  one of the best computer school in the country, i am really looking forward to studying science. 
	so i was just wondering if, what if u were born 30 or 40 years from now, would you have your own robot. sounds like science fiction i know.  but what
if u were born 40 years back would u consider to hold a sheet of highly engineered metals everywhere, would you even imagine talking to someone through it,
even better will u believe if u can even talk to them through a majic mirror like thing face to face. well all those became real. so what makes u think that
having a personal robot is impossible. well we are on a verge of getting there with 10 to 20 years. so i'll ask you,"what kind of robot would you want".
	well its not an easy answer u might say that you would rather look at all the models and kinds of robots, plus if u can afford them too obviously.
if u ask me i would be seeking a robot that is very practical. it can be a robot that can do massage, it can know how to drive, it can have a gadget that
can let you fly around. pretty cool huh. yeah i know. but my answer would be a robot that can turn into a car like the transformers movie, not as big as
a house thought. im sure my friends would love to have a robot like the iron man, just wearing it like a suit and flying around fells more practical. some
people thats not me might say they want a robot that is able to be a companion, a helper robot that can do your home work, can help u with calculus, wait
i want a robot that can help me with calculus.
	so if some one offered me a custom robot i will probably choose the one that looks good, curvy edges, slick design.it kind of reminds me of the 
movie i robot.
